# rocket_csrf_guard

This is a collection of utilities for adding CSRF protection to Rocket powered web applications.

This is a useful building block for secure by default frameworks, [as seen in this blogpost](https://mhlakhani.com/blog/2024/01/on-secure-by-default-frameworks/)

Works with rocket 0.5.0 and above.

Look at the documentation and examples to learn more.
